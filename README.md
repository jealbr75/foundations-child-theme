An Accessibility Child Theme for Bricks
The purpose of this child theme is to help fill in the missing accessibility aspects that the Bricks Builder has missed, overlooked, or neglected. This child theme will also address some missing features that Frameworks such as ACSS and CoreFramework don't cover.

As necessary accessibility aspects are found, I will attempt to add them to this child theme in an effort to help fill that gap and help you to attempt to reach a score of 85 or better.

Please note, this child theme is not an accessibility plugin nor do I claim it will help you to achieve an 85 or to ever be compliant. However again, it will help assist you.

One final note, there will be no auto-updates for this child theme. I want you, the end user, to have the freedom to ADD TO this child theme without fear of your own custom coding being overwritten.
